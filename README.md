# C++ Problem Solving - OOP, STL, and DSA

This repository contains solutions and learning resources for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Standard Template Library (STL)**, and **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in C++. The aim is to strengthen foundational concepts in C++ through practical problem-solving and implementation of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **STL Implementations**: Efficient use of STL containers like vectors, maps, sets, stacks, queues, and algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and heaps.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practice ground to enhance C++ skills through hands-on experience in solving problems and learning efficient programming techniques using STL, DSA, and core OOP concepts.
